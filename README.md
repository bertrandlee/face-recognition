# Face recognition with Keras, DLib and OpenCV
Accelerate Capstone project that recognizes trained facial identities, 
and also predicts age, gender and emotion all within a single self-contained platform.
Uses CMU's OpenFace implementation of Google's FaceNet CNN model, evaluated with subset of LFW data set.
